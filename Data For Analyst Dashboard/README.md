In these directories you can find scripts that retrieve data from 3 types of sources: webpage, API, and a mysql database. 

After retrieving data, the scripts clean and transform it. Finally, the data gets inserted into a mysql database.

That mysql database is connected to a Tableau dashboard and hence this directory is called "Data For Analyst Dashboard".
