In these directories, you will find scripts I developed for data retrieval, cleaning, and transformation, which are essential steps before modeling. 

Each directory includes a brief explanation of how to use the code.

Please note that the actual model is not included here, as it is proprietary to Vesper. 
However, I would be happy to demonstrate a similar type of model during an interview.
